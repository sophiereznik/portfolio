            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a rising junior studying Computer Science with a minor in Information Technology 
                at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am a member of the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) as a competitor for 
                the Team Tech division and Director of the Collegiate Mentorship committee. I am also 
                a member of the Association for Computing Machinery for Women (AMC-W) as the Marketing 
                Officer, managing the social media and announcements for club events. Additionally, 
                I am the Outreach Coordinator for Code the Gap, a club that aims to provide students 
                with a computer science education starting young, by teaching introductory Python 
                courses at local schools.</p>
            <p>Aside from my leadership roles, I am involved with other student organizations. I am an
                 active member of Engineers without Borders, Girls Who Code, and Women in Mathematics. 
                 Alongside these clubs, I am also a mentor with CSE Mentor Connect which pairs mentors 
                 with freshmen mentees in the College of Science and Engineering.</p>
